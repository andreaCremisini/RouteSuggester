# RouteSuggester
Creating an Android application that has the purpose of suggesting routes to follow. These routes have been selected by routes already made by other users: through the Flickr API and Yelp, they are extracted from information published photos on Flickr and you performed a matching with the Yelp information. Finally we are suggested to the user of the routes in Rome, preferring the longer route to its current position.The project has been done with Matteo Sabatini. <br /><br />
